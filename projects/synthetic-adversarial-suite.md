# Synthetic Adversarial Suite - Extension

**Keywords:**  Synthetic, ShadowModels, TabularData

**Need:**  The privacy of data in the NHS is a key issue.  Whilst synthetic data generation can overcome some privacy concerns, there still aren't robust metrics that can demonstrate a high degree of confidence that a synthetic dataset is indeed private.  An alternative approach to proving the privacy of a dataset statistically is to show that a range of common attacks yield no success.  The Synthetic Adversarial Suite was developed as a way of creating membership inference attacks (among others) to demonstrate if a generated dataset was leaking privacy.  The initial development of this suite was successful but only includes two attack avenues.  This project would seek to extend this suite by investigating and implementing additional attacks that could be used on a synthetic dataset.   

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:**  The current codebase is closed for security.  See [Membership Inference Attacks against Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05820); [GAN-Leaks: A Taxonomy of Membership Inference Attacks against Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03935); and [LOGAN: Evaluating Privacy Leakage of Generative Models Using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317061929_LOGAN_Evaluating_Privacy_Leakage_of_Generative_Models_Using_Generative_Adversarial_Networks) for background reading into the area.


**Related Previous Internship Projects:** Not a previous intern project but the Synthetic Adversarial Suite was commissioned and development in early 2022 and currently contained in a closed repoistory.

**Enables Future Work:**  Increases the confidence of generating and using synthetic data in the NHS by demonstrating the ability of a dataset to withstand adversarial attacks.

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** Additional attack algorithms added to the suite

**Datasets:** CTDC or similar published synthetic dataset with known model architecture.  

**Desired skill set:**  When applying please highlight any experience around adversarial machine learning (incl. Membership inference, and model inversion), code development, python coding experience (including any coding in the open), any other data science experience you feel relevant.
