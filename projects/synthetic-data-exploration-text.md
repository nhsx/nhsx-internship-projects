# Synthetic Data Exploration: 
## Text

**Keywords:** Synthetic, Natural Language Processing, Healthcare Text

**Need:** Text data in the NHS is vastly underused due to issues around appropriate access and the subtleties when analysing free text.  Providing generated synthetic medical text in various realistic formats would enable greater opportunity to identify potential, and develop innovation.  This project would seek to build a methodology for creating publicly available synthetically generated medical notes and patient letters for developers of healthcare software and apps.   

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:** Utilising and building on recent work in generating synthetic medical text e.g. [Generation and evaluation of artificial mental health records for Natural Language Processing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0267-x), [SynthNotes: A Generator Framework for High-volume, High-fidelity Synthetic Mental Health Notes](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1507868), and [Exploring Transformer Text Generation for Medical Dataset Augmentation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.578.pdf) and exploration of the techniques on other data sources.

**Related Previous Internship Projects:** n/a as first year of the scheme

**Enables Future Work:** Envisaged that as synthetic text generation has a range of possible approaches and nuances that this project will lead into a series of projects that build off one another.  Additionally, the work will support the “NHS Language Model” and projects seeking to make useful NHS data available for public usage.  

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** As the need is for developer usage rather than research, the complexity of the output and the quality score can be relatively low.   Thus the output can range from a “bag of words” to realistic letter structures that are internally consistent with other electronic health records.  The output can either be a methodology that has a clear utility, privacy and quality score associated or specific product extract with medical text examples within. 

**Datasets:** Mostly working with Mimic III data (possibility of CRIS data) for training but would like to ensure that the training dataset can be updated to a UK specific one in the future (requires IG training prior to project start).

**Desired skill set:** When applying please highlight any experience around work with text data and specifically medical text data, natural language processing, training and evaluating models, understanding of bias in text training data, coding experience (including any coding in the open), any other data science experience you feel relevant.
